# Admin Security Update - Project Changes

## Overview
Removed frontend admin login and implemented backend-managed admin system with enhanced security and functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Admin Login Component
- Deleted `/admin-login` component and route
- Admin users now login through regular `/login` page
- System automatically detects admin privileges from backend

### 2. Enhanced Admin Dashboard
- Added document viewing functionality for applications
- Added approval/rejection system with required reasons
- Added email notification options for admin actions
- Improved UI with modals for better user experience

### 3. Security Improvements
- Password fields are properly secured (type="password")
- Admin access controlled entirely by backend `is_staff` and `is_superuser` flags
- Automatic redirection based on user privileges
- Centralized authentication through AuthService

### 4. New Admin Features
- **Document Viewer**: View and download application documents
- **Approval System**: Approve/reject with mandatory reasons
- **Email Notifications**: Send notifications to applicants
- **User Management**: Full CRUD operations on users
- **Content Management**: Create announcements, events, meetings

### 5. Backend Integration Points
The following backend endpoints are expected:

```
POST /api/admin/applications/{id}/update-status/
- Body: { status: 'approved'|'rejected', reason: string, send_email: boolean }

GET /api/admin/applications/{id}/documents/
- Returns: [{ name: string, type: string, url: string }]

POST /api/notifications/announcements/
POST /api/notifications/events/
POST /api/admin/users/
```

### 6. User Flow
1. **Regular Users**: Login → User Dashboard
2. **Admin Users**: Login → Admin Dashboard (auto-detected)
3. **Admin Actions**: All actions require reasons and can trigger email notifications

### 7. Security Features
- No frontend admin credentials
- Backend-controlled admin privileges
- Secure password handling
- Document access control
- Audit trail through required reasons

## Next Steps for Backend
1. Implement document storage and retrieval
2. Add email notification system
3. Create admin action logging
4. Implement user management endpoints
5. Add document security controls
